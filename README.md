# NotebookLM Evaluation — Week 5 (Governance, Security, DevOps)

**Purpose.** Evidence log for Q4(c): evaluate Google NotebookLM features using my Week-5 course material (PDF not included).

**Method.** I tested five features (Q&A with citations, Study Guide/Reports, Mind Map, Flashcards, Audio Overview). For each I checked: (i) accuracy vs the PDF wording, (ii) citation correctness, (iii) usefulness for study/teaching. Results are logged in `evidence_table.csv`.

**Key findings (summary).**
- Q&A: 9/10 correct with working citations; one availability answer missed HA/backup nuance.
- Study Guide: good outline; omitted “non-repudiation” once.
- Mind Map: correct clusters; lacks citations on edges.
- Flashcards: 8/10 precise; two generic.
- Audio Overview: aligned with guide; no citations by design.
